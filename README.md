# wardrobe-management
In 21st century, fashion is not just something we wear, it's a way of life. The amount and type of clothing worn is dependent on physical stature, gender, as well as social and geographic considerations. Our aim is to build a compelling, interactive and highly realistic virtual system, where users/customers can choose between many different types of garment designs and proceed to simulate these garments on virtual users. The system “Virtual Dressing Environment” involves virtually trying out different cloth models which is done by mining of the user choices. Our goal here is to save time of the users during trying out different attires and this technique seems to be a good solution for a quick accurate try-on of garments. This technique requires no expensive configurations and time-consuming build-ups. It generates outfits automatically based on the registered wardrobe.
